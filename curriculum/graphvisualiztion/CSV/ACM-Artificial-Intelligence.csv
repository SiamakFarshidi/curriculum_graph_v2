3,,,,,,Artificial Intelligence (AI),,,-,,,,
3,1,,,,,Fundamental Issues,,Fundamental Issues,-,Explain,,,
3,1,1,,,,"Overview of AI problems, Examples of successful recent AI applications",,Fundamental Issues,-,Explain,,"AI problems encompass tasks like natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning.",
3,1,2,,,,"Definitions of agents with examples (e.g., reactive, deliberative)",,Fundamental Issues,-,Explain,,Agents are autonomous entities that perceive their environment and act upon it to achieve goals.,
3,1,3,,,,What is intelligent behavior?,,Fundamental Issues,-,Explain,,"Intelligent behavior involves the ability to adapt to new situations, solve problems, learn from experience, and achieve goals effectively.",
3,1,3,1,,,The Turing test and its flaws,,Fundamental Issues,-,Explain,,"The Turing test is a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit human-like intelligence in conversation. Its flaws include the inability to assess all aspects of intelligence, such as creativity and emotional understanding, and the potential for deception by machines through narrow task-specific intelligence.",
3,1,3,2,,,Multimodal input and output,,Fundamental Issues,-,Explain,,"Multimodal input refers to the use of multiple sensory channels (e.g., text, speech, image) for interaction with AI systems. Multimodal output involves presenting information or responses through various modalities (e.g., text, speech, graphics) to enhance user experience and accessibility.",
3,1,3,3,,,Simulation of intelligent behavior,,Fundamental Issues,-,Explain,,"Simulation of intelligent behavior involves creating models or systems that mimic aspects of human intelligence, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and learning. I",
3,1,3,4,,,Rational versus non-rational reasoning,,Fundamental Issues,-,Explain,,"Rational reasoning involves making decisions that maximize expected utility or achieve predefined goals based on available information. Non-rational reasoning may involve heuristics, biases, or instinctive behaviors that do not always lead to optimal outcomes, as observed in human decision-making.",
3,1,4,,,,Problem characteristics,,Fundamental Issues,-,Evaluate,,,
3,1,4,1,,,Fully versus partially observable,,Fundamental Issues,-,Evaluate,,"Fully observable problems are those where all relevant information about the current state is available to the agent. Partially observable problems are those where only a limited amount of information is available, making it necessary for the agent to maintain beliefs about the state based on available observations.",
3,1,4,2,,,Single versus multi-agent,,Fundamental Issues,-,Evaluate,,"Single-agent problems involve a single autonomous entity making decisions in an environment. Multi-agent problems involve multiple autonomous entities interacting with each other and the environment, often with conflicting goals or cooperative behavior.",
3,1,4,3,,,Deterministic versus stochastic,,Fundamental Issues,-,Evaluate,,"Deterministic problems have outcomes that are entirely determined by the initial state and the actions taken. Stochastic problems involve uncertainty or randomness in the outcomes, where the same action in the same state may lead to different outcomes.",
3,1,4,4,,,Static versus dynamic,,Fundamental Issues,-,Evaluate,,"Static problems have fixed environments where the state does not change while the agent is deliberating. Dynamic problems involve environments that change over time, requiring the agent to continuously adapt its decisions in response to these changes.",
3,1,4,5,,,Discrete versus continuous,,Fundamental Issues,-,Evaluate,,"Discrete problems have a finite or countably infinite set of possible states, actions, or outcomes. Continuous problems involve an infinite set of possible states, actions, or outcomes, often requiring numerical methods for representation and solution.",
